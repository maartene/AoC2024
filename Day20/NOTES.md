## General comments
Today was rough. Although after a lot of trial and error, I got an algorithm working that was able to solve part one.
Mind you - it took 45 minutes to run (while I was playing FFXIV). 

For Part 2 this wasn't an option. So I had to resort to Reddit to understand a better solution. I found the algorithm and was able to run it on paper to really understand it. Then it took another hour or so to get it implemented correctly. Finally though, the second star was mine.
Then another 30 minutes or so cleaning up code. Quite happy where it is now.
