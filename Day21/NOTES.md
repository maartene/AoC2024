# AoC Day 21 - 📝 Notes from the journey 🍅 by 🍅

## 🏷️ Labels

- ✅ done
- 🚧 WIP
- ❌ ERROR
- ⚠️ TODO

## 🍅 Pomodoro 1
- ✅ Read the description
- ✅ Import the input data
- 🚧 Triangulate outside in (obvious part)
    - ✅ fake example expected output
    - ✅ first pass: where does this value come from? Adding together the complexity of individual code sequences.
    - ✅ second pass: how is the individual complexity score calculating? By multiplying numeric part and length of shortest sequence
- 🚧 The actual puzzle: how to determine the shortest input sequence for the intended sequence?
    - ⚠️ Can we do this outside in? I.e. determine the path for the 'outer robot' first?
- ⚠️ Make the example input pass
