# AoC Day 24 - 📝 Notes from the journey 🍅 by 🍅

## 🏷️ Labels

- ✅ done
- 🚧 WIP
- ❌ ERROR
- ⚠️ TODO

## 🍅 Pomodoro 1 - expand the small example
- ✅ Read the description
- ✅ Import the input data
- ✅ Extract the logic from the small example
- ✅ Parse initial state

## 🍅 Pomodoro 2 - parse the wires and apply them in the small example
- ✅ Make the example input pass for the small example (without hard coded values)
- ✅ The larger example

## 🍅 Pomodoro 3 - part one
- ✅ Get the first ⭐️
- ✅ Cleanup part one

## 🍅 Pomodoro 4 - part two
- 📄The plan:
    - Find at what 'bit' the input breaks
    - Use the bits before that to create a known good case
    - Create a simple test case out of that to test the solution
    - Build up a solution for a test case with one swap, then two, ...
- ✅ Create an arbitrary state from a number, so I can initiaze a circuit with known input and expected output
